1)There were major errors which occured when I implemented the whole thing at once.

2)I build the project from scratch again only this time I built it step by step , 
	i)created outer component , verified it with client
	ii)created inner component , verified it with client
	iii)placed the code necessary to contain the methods of inner component inside the outer component.
	iv)changed the client accordingly.

3) The issue still persisting is of the client , who knows that the inner component exists and is registering it for the outer component.


TODO//This registering must be done by the outer component.
